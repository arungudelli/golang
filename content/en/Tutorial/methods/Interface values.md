  <h2>Interface values</h2>
  
  
  <p>
    Under the hood, interface values can be thought of as a tuple of a value and a


    concrete type:
  </p>
  

  
  <pre>(value, type)</pre>
  

  
  <p>
    An interface value holds a value of a specific underlying concrete type.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Calling a method on an interface value executes the method of the same name on


    its underlying type.
  </p>
