  <h2>Interfaces</h2>
  
  
  <p>
    An <i>interface type</i> is defined as a set of method signatures.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    A value of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> There is an error in the example code on line 22.


    <code>Vertex</code> (the value type) doesn't implement <code>Abser</code> because


    the <code>Abs</code> method is defined only on <code>*Vertex</code> (the pointer type).
  </p>
