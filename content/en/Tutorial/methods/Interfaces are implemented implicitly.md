  <h2>Interfaces are implemented implicitly</h2>
  
  
  <p>
    A type implements an interface by implementing its methods.


    There is no explicit declaration of intent, no "implements" keyword.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Implicit interfaces decouple the definition of an interface from its


    implementation, which could then appear in any package without prearrangement.
  </p>
