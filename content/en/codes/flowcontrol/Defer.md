  <h2>Defer</h2>
  
  
  <p>
    A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding


    function returns.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    The deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call


    is not executed until the surrounding function returns.
  </p>
