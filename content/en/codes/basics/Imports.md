  <h2>Imports</h2>
  
  
  <p>
    This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    You can also write multiple import statements, like:
  </p>
  

  
  <pre>import "fmt"
import "math"</pre>
  

  
  <p>
    But it is good style to use the factored import statement.
  </p>
