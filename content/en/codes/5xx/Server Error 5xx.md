   The 5xx (Server Error) class of status code indicates that the server
   is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the
   requested method.  Except when responding to a HEAD request, the
   server SHOULD send a representation containing an explanation of the
   error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent









   condition.  A user agent SHOULD display any included representation
   to the user.  These response codes are applicable to any request
   method.
