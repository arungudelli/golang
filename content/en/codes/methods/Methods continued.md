  <h2>Methods continued</h2>
  
  
  <p>
    You can declare a method on non-struct types, too.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    In this example we see a numeric type <code>MyFloat</code> with an <code>Abs</code> method.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    You can only declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in the same


    package as the method.


    You cannot declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in another


    package (which includes the built-in types such as <code>int</code>).
