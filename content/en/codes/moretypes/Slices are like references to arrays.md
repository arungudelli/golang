  <h2>Slices are like references to arrays</h2>
  
  
  <p>
    A slice does not store any data,


    it just describes a section of an underlying array.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Changing the elements of a slice modifies the


    corresponding elements of its underlying array.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Other slices that share the same underlying array will see those changes.
  </p>
