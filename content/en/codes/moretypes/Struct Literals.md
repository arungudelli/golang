  <h2>Struct Literals</h2>
  
  
  <p>
    A struct literal denotes a newly allocated struct value by listing the values of its fields.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    You can list just a subset of fields by using the <code>Name:</code> syntax. (And the order of named fields is irrelevant.)
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    The special prefix <code>&amp;</code> returns a pointer to the struct value.
  </p>
